Practising TypeScript with a project idea from ChatGPT

# Project Name:
TypeScript Quiz App

# Description:
You are tasked with building a small web application that allows users to take a quiz. The app should have the following features:

- **Quiz Setup**: The app should allow an admin to set up quizzes. Each quiz can have multiple-choice questions with four options and one correct answer. Admins should be able to add, edit, and delete questions.

- **User Authentication**: The app should support user registration and login. Only logged-in users should be able to attempt the quizzes.

- **Quiz Taking**: Logged-in users should be able to see the available quizzes and attempt them. The app should display one question at a time and provide feedback after each question is answered. Users should be able to see their score at the end of the quiz.

- **Leaderboard**: The app should display a leaderboard that shows the top users based on their quiz scores.

- **Styling and User Experience**: Make the app user-friendly and visually appealing with responsive design.

# Technical Requirements:
- Use TypeScript for the entire project.
- Use Node.js and Express.js for the backend.
- Use a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) to store quiz data, user information, and quiz results.
- Use a frontend framework like React or Angular to build the user interface.
- Implement user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or any other secure authentication method.
- Ensure proper error handling and validation throughout the application.
